Code for plots from decentralizeddiffusion.github.io and flowreinforce.github.io is available here.

Decentralized Diffusion Models:
- plot_one.html
- plot_two.html
- plot_three.html

Flow Matching Policy Gradients:
- flow_sde_plot.html
- advantage_flow_plot.html

Please note that these were heavily vibe coded and are quite disorganized. I find Claude 4 is still able to explain and modify them effectively.
